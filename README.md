We will be working with the concepts of Elasticity and Inelasticity and the relation this has to Products. Now this is a very important concept for data analysis in the actual world; our insights will have repercussions on the business and its important we understand how these insights tie into the business. Say for example, if we suddenly had our Netflix account fees raise to $100 per month - a number of us might reconsider whether we still want this subscription. The insight here is that the product is *elastic* (i.e. if we increase the price too sharply, people will leave and go to other streaming platforms). This is tied to the concept of Elasticity (i.e. when the price is low enough, demand is high. Inversely, when the price is high - demand reduces). Now, there are situations that even IF the price rises, we will still purchase the same quantity of goods. Take for example, a particular drug for a pre-existing medical condition. If the price was to rise from its current amount to 10% higher than usual - the amount demanded won't decrease as the product is still required. When this occurs, the product is known as an *inelastic* product. (i.e. Regardless of whether the demand increases or decreases, the price will not change in any substantial manner). With what you've learned, let's take a look at Southern Water Corps Economic Data and see what trends we can identify from an Elasticity and Inelasticity Perspective. Let's be objective and ask ourselves - what does the data tell us? 

# Q1. Please calculate the Average Water Balancing Market Price (WBMP) and Average Quantities of Water Demanded for 1) Hard and Soft Water Combined, 2) Hard Water Only and 3) Soft Water Only across Jan-14 to Dec-14. Do you notice any trends when comparing the Price and Quantity Per Product? 

We've now taken a look at the data and we can see that there may exist some type of relationship between Quantity of Water Procured and the Overall Price. 
However, it would be easiest to visually consume this information at both a monthly and daily level. We'll do this first at a macro and then micro level.

# Q2. Using a Scatter Plot and the data you've calculated above, with the Y-Axis set to Avg. Quantity of Water and X-Axis set to Avg. WMBP, create three (3) separate charts showing the Overall (Hard Water + Soft Water) Scatter Plot, Hard Water Scatter Plot and Soft Water Scatter Plot. Note whether the relationship appears to be Elastic or Inelastic alongside your reason as to why this is the case.

We've now taken plotted three (3) scatter plots and identified whether or not the trend looks elastic or inelastic.
This is the macro view of our analysis. 

As Data Analysts, it is equally important that we take a micro oriented view of the data.
Often looking at the data from a 'macro' perspective, gives us an indication of where we might look and a 'micro' view provides a clearer approach as to whether or not our macro trend is actually legitimate or not. 

# Q3. Using a Scatter Plot and the data in the Water Trading Repository Table, create three (3) separate charts showing the Overall (Hard Water + Soft Water) Scatter Plot, Hard Water Scatter Plot and Soft Water Scatter Plots. (Note: Set the X-axis to the Price and the Y-Axis to the Quantity of Water) Note whether the relationship appears to be Elastic or Inelastic alongside your reason as to why this is the case. Remember, this is the micro analysis so we are now using the Raw Data Entries (individual data points in the Water Trading Repository Table Tab) as opposed to the aggregated averages.
